## Known TypeScript / Next.js 15 Gotchas

These have burned us before — always apply:

- **Route params must be Promise**: `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }` and `const { id } = await params`
- **No spread on iterators**: Use `Array.from(set)` not `[...set]` — TypeScript downlevel compat issue
- **Map.values() spread**: Use `Array.from(new Map(...).values())` not `[...new Map(...).values()]`
- **Stripe SDK v20**: `PromotionCodeCreateParams` uses `promotion: { type: 'coupon', coupon: id }` not top-level `coupon: id`
- **Supabase client in API routes**: Use inline `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` with cookie handlers — `@/lib/supabase/server` does NOT exist in this codebase
- **Login redirect param**: Login page reads `?redirect=` not `?next=` — always use `router.push('/login?redirect=/path')`

## Key Infrastructure Decisions

- **Infrastructure sustainability is always a priority** — Joshua is ballin on a budget. Every new feature needs quota gating or a clear cost model.
- **Credits system:** Three pools — monthly (resets), earned (referrals/milestones), purchased (never expire). Consumed in that order.
- **Publish-first architecture:** Post status is set atomically to prevent race conditions.
- **Idempotency guards** on all scheduled jobs — nothing fires twice.
- **RLS on all tables** — users only access their own data.
- **Feature flags table** in Supabase — admin-only write, for kill switches.
- **Inngest cron `'0 6 * * *'`** — evergreen recycling runs daily.
- **Enki Truth Mode scan** — Inngest cron `'*/15 * * * *'`, per-user isolation, Yahoo Finance OHLCV.
- If a feature could have API costs, gate it like AI credits. Build for free-tier sustainability first.

## Known Issues / Bugs (fix these when touched)

- **Partial post UX** — when a post publishes to some platforms but not others, the calendar shows "Partial" with no explanation. Users should see "Bluesky ✓ · X blocked (quota)" or similar. Not built yet.

## Audit Findings (April 19–20, 2026) — resolved

- ✅ Broken `/affiliate` links in `/give` and `/referral` — now correctly point to `/affiliates` (PR #160)
- ✅ Exposed debug route `/api/merch/debug` — deleted (PR #160)
- ✅ Missing try/catch in `/api/feature-requests` POST — added (PR #160)
- ✅ `posts_status_check` DB constraint missing `failed` and `partial` values — migration added (PR #173). **Must run SQL in Supabase if not auto-applied:** `ALTER TABLE posts DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS posts_status_check; ALTER TABLE posts ADD CONSTRAINT posts_status_check CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'scheduled', 'published', 'failed', 'partial', 'pending_approval'));`
- ✅ Twitter quota plan lookup bug — personal workspace defaulted to 'free' plan (50 limit) because `workspaceId=null` caused empty DB lookup. Fixed to query by `owner_id + is_personal=true` (PR #175)
- ✅ Admin email (`socialmatehq@gmail.com`) now bypasses X quota entirely (PR #175)

---

## Admin Tools (built Apr 20, 2026)

- `GET /api/admin/rescue-scheduled` — shows count of posts stuck in 'scheduled' past their scheduled_at
- `POST /api/admin/rescue-scheduled` — force-publishes all stuck posts via `fromInngest:true`, force-fails any that still error so they don't stay stuck forever
- `GET /api/admin/post-diagnostics` — shows today's partial/failed posts with per-platform success/fail breakdown from `platform_post_ids`

Run rescue in browser console (must be logged in as socialmatehq@gmail.com):
```js
fetch('/api/admin/rescue-scheduled', {method:'POST'}).then(r=>r.json()).then(d=>console.log(JSON.stringify(d,null,2)))
```

---

## Pending / In Progress

- **Content posts (Apr 20–26)** — bulk-scheduled, running daily 8am–5pm ET on X + Bluesky. Inngest now confirmed working. Posts going out as "Partial" because of the quota bug (now fixed in PR #175). May need to manually retry missed morning slots.

- **Inngest env vars** — confirmed needed: `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` + `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` in Vercel. Posts were not publishing until these were set. Verify they're still set after any Vercel config changes.

- **Partial post UX** — show per-platform result in calendar/queue UI. "Bluesky ✓ · X ✗ (quota)" style. Not built yet.

- **SM-Give renewal tracking** — `invoice.payment_succeeded` now handled (PR #164). Confirmed done.

- **Growth partner trial (Abdus Sohag)** — 1-week trial active as of Apr 19. Referral link: `?ref=SOHAG`. Review end of week; if strong, set up contract + renegotiate to standard affiliate rates.

- **Enki Truth Mode testing** — market opens Apr 21; first real signal data expected then. 50-trade minimum per strategy before results are valid.

- **Discord management tools** (future — moderation, welcome messages, role automation)
- **Gilgamesh's Guide landing page** (future — free PDF, business/creator/self-dev guide for entrepreneurs)
- **LinkedIn integration** — API credentials not yet acquired

## Confirmed Done (stop asking about these)

- ✅ **Login redirect** — all Enki pages use `?redirect=` not `?next=`. Fixed.
- ✅ **Stripe SDK v20 promo code params** — `promotion: { type: 'coupon', coupon: id }` format confirmed and in use.
- ✅ **enkiTruthModeScan** — registered in `app/api/inngest/route.ts`. Running every 15 min.

- ✅ **SM-Give renewal tracking** — `invoice.payment_succeeded` now records 2% to `sm_give_allocations` with source `subscription_renewal`. Only fires on `billing_reason = subscription_cycle`. PR #164.
- ✅ **SM-Give webhook integration** — `sm_give_allocations` writes added to Stripe webhook: 2% of subscription checkouts, 100% of donation checkouts. Both non-fatal. PR #148 merged.
- ✅ **Supabase migrations (Apr 18)** — `sm_give_allocations`, `merch_waitlist` confirmed ran.
- ✅ **Supabase email confirmation** — "Confirm email" toggle is ON (verified Apr 19). Users must confirm before first sign-in.
- ✅ **Merch Printify shop ID** — Real shop ID `27238436` found via debug endpoint. `PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID` env var added to Vercel. Fixed in `merch/page.tsx`, `merch/checkout/route.ts`, and `stripe/webhook/route.ts`. PR #157 merged.
- ✅ **Merch variant image** — `MerchProductCard` now updates image when user selects a different color/size. PR #158 merged.

- ✅ **Platform account jail (Apr 20)** — `platform_account_registry` table tracks Twitter accounts with 45-day global cooldown on disconnect. Anti-abuse: disconnecting and reconnecting to reset quota is blocked.
- ✅ **Enki Guardian toggle on dashboard (Apr 20)** — Fortress Guard toggle now on the dashboard page directly. Pending approvals banner + 24-hr auto-expiry on stale trades.
- ✅ **Enki leaderboard nav fix (Apr 20)** — Leaderboard now renders Enki nav, not public SocialMate nav.

## Weekly Content System

Each Friday (or end of sprint), archive the current CLAUDE.md as `CLAUDE-week-of-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
Then diff the two files through Gemini/Claude to generate a week's worth of social posts based on what changed.
The diff = the story. Ship it to every platform.

---

## Coding Rules

- **Always consider infrastructure cost** — if it hits an external API, it needs quota gating
- **Use prebuilt/existing patterns** — don't reinvent. Reuse existing auth, RLS, Inngest, Stripe patterns already in the codebase
- **Token efficiency matters** — run focused, targeted tasks. Use plan mode (Shift+Tab) for complex multi-file work before writing code
- **Mobile first** — always check iPhone notch, touch targets (44×44px min), safe area insets
- **No hardcoded wrong numbers** — check actual Stripe price IDs in Appendix B before touching payment code
- **Don't break what works** — UI/UX must flow cleanly. If unsure, ask before touching working flows
- **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
- **One branch + one PR per fix** — never accumulate changes from multiple fixes onto one branch
- **Always open a PR after pushing** — push + PR is one step, always provide the direct PR link
- **Update CLAUDE.md** every time a significant feature ships

## What NOT to Touch Without Asking

- Stripe webhook handler — live payments depend on it. The coupon affiliate commission block (added April 2026) is the only intentional addition; don't touch the rest
- RLS policies — they're in place for security, don't remove or bypass
- Inngest publish jobs — idempotency guards are critical, don't remove them
- The three-pool credit system logic — complex, tested, working
- Any env vars — don't suggest hardcoding these

## Context: The Human Behind This

Joshua works a deli job and builds this in his spare hours. He's solo, bootstrapped, budget-conscious. Every decision needs to consider:

1. Does this cost money at scale?
2. Can we use a free tier, prebuilt solution, or existing pattern instead?
3. Does this break anything that's already working?

He's not building features for features' sake. He's building toward 2,000–4,000 paying Pro users and $10k–$20k MRR in 12 months. Every task should move the needle on stability, growth, or user trust.

**Goal: Power to the people. Build the door.**
